# ChipHeadBang
Design for an USB to Serial converter with ICSP header for (slow) bitbang programming, based on the CH340G chip. See http://samelimmat.blogspot.com/2015/04/introducing-chipheadbang.html

While this seems to work pretty well, and the CH340G can be obtained extremely cheaply from sources such as 
AliExpress, driver support can be a bit iffy. For current versions of OS X, the vendor provided driver will 
cause kernel panics, and as far as I know, only this commercial alternative will work: https://www.mac-usb-serial.com
